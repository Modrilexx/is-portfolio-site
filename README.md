# IS Portfolio Site

## Reflection (≈200 words)

I created this portfolio website using GitHub Pages and a spec-driven workflow. I started by creating a new GitHub repository and cloning it to my computer using the terminal. After that, I created three main files: index.html for the structure, style.css for the design, and script.js for a small interactive feature (automatically displaying the current year in the footer). I used nano to edit each file directly in the terminal, which helped me understand exactly where the content was coming from and how the files connect to each other.

Once the site files were finished, I used git commands (git add, git commit, and git push) to upload my work back to GitHub. The final step was enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings so the website could be deployed from the main branch. Seeing my changes go from local files to a live public webpage helped me understand the full workflow of building and publishing a site.

Overall, I learned how to break a vague requirement into clear steps, how version control tracks my progress, and how deployment is part of the development process.
